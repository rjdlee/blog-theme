            <p>
                I am a frontend software engineer focused on rapidly delivering engaging user experiences without
                sacrificing long term cadence. I recognize and solve process shortcomings, whether that means
                re-implementing an entire test suite or building React component libraries. I'm also an 'artist'.

            The way I see it, as long as you have your eyes open, the world is rife with business and life
            opportunities. I've been involved in the business world ever since selling LED bulbs to my high school
            teachers. These are the stories of my business adventures and what I learned from them. My current ventures
            are secret, though.

            The best way to learn is through experiencing. The second best way is through storytelling. Shower thoughts
            are written to close gaps I see in readily available information. I try to understand and explain why things
            are the way they are. Drawings are bonus payoffs for reading through my works.

            I'm a strong believer in having both high level vision and technical skills to execute on those visions.
            With humble beginnings building websites in Adobe Dreamweaver over 10 years ago, I've developed robust
            foundations that allow me to work anywhere on the tech stack from firmware to web to distributed systems.
            These are the stories of what I've learned hacking Medium, building games, automating plant care, and more.

            I started programming because I wanted to build a flash games website. Since then, I've built countless web
